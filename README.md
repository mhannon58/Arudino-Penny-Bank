# Arudino-Penny-Bank

This was a final project for my microcontrollers course at Umass Amherst. The concept was a penny bank that would automatically eject and keep track of funds. A servo motor powered the ejection and a photolight sensor acted as a beam break to determine when a coin would enter the system. The lcd screen would then display the total amount.
